A case study tracking adversary infrastructure through SSL certificate use featuring Fancy Bear/APT28/Sofacy.
A long time ago, in a galaxy... No. Stop. We're not doing that anymore. Instead, we're pivoting to Game of Thrones, or A Song of Ice and Fire for you bookworms, because the fantastical realm provides great material we can relate to cybersecurity.

This research builds off our previous work using SSL certificates and splash pages to proactively identify Fancy Bear infrastructure. We identified a SSL certificate subject string that Fancy Bear has used consistently since 2016, which further illuminates their infrastructure and registration tactics. Our hope is that in addition to the indicators themselves, our readers will apply these techniques to their research on other adversaries.

We'll walk through the process of how we conducted this research, which used ThreatConnect, Censys, Farsight Security Passive DNS, RiskIQ, and DomainTools. To date, this line of research has identified 47 IPs, 46 domains, 33 registrant email addresses, and 47 SSL certificates shared in ThreatConnect in Incident 20180209C: "C=GB, ST=London, L=London, O=Security, OU=IT" Certificate Infrastructure. It also underscores consistent Fancy Bear tactics including:

Use of small or boutique hosting service providers such as Domains4Bitcoins, ITitch, and NJALLA.
Minimizing the reuse of email addresses to register domains.
Regular use of email domains sapo[.]pt, mail[.]com, centrum[.]cz, and cock[.]li or privacy protection services.
Domain registration and SSL certificate creation times that are consistent with an actor operating in Moscow.


The Watchers in the Night

Everybody thinks they are House Stark material, but we would assert cybersecurity personnel are more like the sworn members of the Night's Watch. You are the watchers on the firewall, the sword in the dark web, and the shield that guards the networks of your organization.

If we're being honest, the ThreatConnect Research team and cyber threat intelligence analysts at large, are most like... wait for it... Samwell Tarly (none of us harbors the delusion of being Jon Snow). Tarly is dedicated to aggregating and analyzing intelligence on threats beyond the wall -- the Night King and his White Walkers -- to better understand how the Night's Watch can react to them and proactively address them.

 



 

Looking for Adversary Infrastructure Using a Common SSL Certificate Subject String

In our recent efforts to proactively address Fancy Bear, we reviewed SSL certificate information in Censys for domains and IPs using a "Coming soon" splash page consistent with previously identified Fancy Bear infrastructure. We found the same subject field used repeatedly -- "C=GB, ST=London, L=London, O=Security, OU=IT, CN=(domain name)" -- as shown below for space-delivery[.]com and webversionact[.]org.



 


Censys SSL certificate information showing consistent use of subject string.

 

This subject line indicates a SSL certificate likely created using OpenSSL, where the creator assigns values for the country (C), state (ST), location (L), organization (O), organizational unit (OU), and common name (CN). It is important to note that the common name is intended to reflect the domain name where the SSL certificate is being used, but in our research we found several instances where this domain name was misspelled or altogether different from the domain where it was used. More on that later.

 

Radiating out: how common is that subject string?

Next, we needed to get an idea of how widely this string is used and what other infrastructure is using similar SSL certificates to gain insight into more possible Fancy Bear infrastructure. Again using Censys, we found 47 certificates that have the same SSL string. In Censys we also queried for IP addresses that host a server using a SSL certificate with that string. The latter provides a view of active infrastructure, while the former can be used to find both historical and active infrastructure.



Censys certificate search results for identified subject string.

 

Careful though: other individuals could easily use OpenSSL to create certificates with the same subject fields; this alone is not sufficient to identify Fancy Bear. Using ThreatConnect's Analyze function we saw that at least 23 of the specified common names have been associated with Fancy Bear attacks. Many of the remaining domains have also been identified through our ongoing research into name servers that Fancy Bear uses. This increases our confidence in assessing that SSL certificates with that subject string probably are associated with Fancy Bear activity.

Stitching together certificates, IP addresses, and the right domains



Censys SSL certificate information for 46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581.

 

At least 39 of the certificates identified in the previous query are no longer in use, but we used RiskIQ to search for the SHA-1 hash and identified the IP addresses that previously hosted a server using that certificate. For example, searching for the previously used SSL certificate 46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581, we saw that it was used at the IP 191.101.31.96.

 



RiskIQ SSL certificate information for 46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581.

 

Reviewing this IP address in ThreatConnect using our integration with Farsight DNSDB, we saw that this IP address hosted the domain remsupport[.]org. This is a notable finding as well because the domain does not correspond to the ecitcom[.]net that was specified in the common name field in the certificate subject, so we took an extra step to make sure we matched up the right certificate to the right domain.

 



ThreatConnect's Farsight Security Passive DNS integration results for 191.101.31.96.

 

Conducting this same process for all of the SSL certificates, we came up with the following list sorted by the SSL certificate's create date/time:

Once that we had a list of the domains, we further enriched this information by identifying the WHOIS information for these domains. Doing so provided historical information on how these domains were registered.

 



 

Gathering Intelligence: Layering on WHOIS Data

To do so, we used some capabilities and integrations from our friends at DomainTools. Specifically, we were looking to identify registrant email addresses, name servers/hosting providers, and creation timestamps. We started by doing a DomainTools Iris search for the domains listed above.



DomainTools Iris search for identified domains.

 

This provided the current WHOIS information for those domains. However, some of the domains have been taken over since they were operational or the WHOIS has otherwise changed since it was registered for use in operations. For any domains where we thought this was the case, we reviewed the WHOIS history in our DomainTools Spaces app to identify the original registration information that corresponds to the timeframe in which the domain was operational.



ThreatConnect's DomainTools Spaces App WHOIS history for adobeupdatetechnology[.]com.

 

Ultimately, we identified the below registration information for these domains.

We have shared this information, including the domains, IPs, and email addresses, with our Common Community in Incident 20180209C: "C=GB, ST=London, L=London, O=Security, OU=IT" Certificate Infrastructure.

 



Assessing Tactics

There are Fancy Bear tactics that we can glean and proactively exploit to identify their activity going forward in addition to monitoring for new domains/IPs that use the aforementioned SSL certificate subject string.

Hosting Service Providers/Name Servers
The domains' original name servers helps identify the hosting service providers that the actors used to procure the infrastructure. These include several providers that we've previously called out, such as Domains4Bitcoins, ITitch, Nemohosts, Carbon2u and NJALLA. We can proactively monitor for newly registered domains using these name servers and with other consistencies to Fancy Bear to potentially identify their infrastructure before it is used in operations.

Email Addresses

We used DomainTools Reverse WHOIS to search for any additional domains registered using the email addresses above. As it turns out, only one of the email addresses -- iflatley@openmailbox[.]org -- registered a second domain (rndversion[.]net). This minimal reuse of email addresses suggests an operational security (opsec) effort to deter efforts to trace out their infrastructure based on known registrants.
